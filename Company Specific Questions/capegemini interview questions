A variable which is declared static, is known as a static variable. These variables are able to retain its value between multiple function calls.

Syntax:

static int y=10;//static variable

Static variables are used because these variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

Static variables are used as common values and are shared by all the methods.

Question 13:
What is the difference between call by value and call by reference in C?

Explanation:
 	
Call by Value

Call by Reference

Description

When a copy of the variable is passed to the function, the original value remains unchanged.

When a copy of the value is passed to the function, the original value gets changed.

Memory location

Formal arguments and actual arguments are created in separate locations in the memory.

Formal arguments and actual arguments are created in the same locations in the memory.

Safety

Actual arguments are reliable as they cannot be modified.

Actual arguments are not reliable as they can be modified

Question 14:
What is Recursion in C?

Explanation:
Recursion is the process where a function calls itself. This function is known as a recursive function. There are 2 phases of recursion:-

Unwinding phase - when the condition is fulfilled, this phase starts and the control is returned to the original call.
Question 15:
What is a pointer in C? What are its uses?

Explanation:
A pointer is a variable referring to the address of a value. When a variable is declared inside a program, the system allocates some memory to it. This memory contains an address number. The variables that hold this address number are called pointer variables.

Syntax: Data_type *p;

P is a pointer variable holding the address number of data_type value.

  Uses of Pointer:-

Pointers are used in accessing elements through an array.  Pointers are used to pass a reference of a variable to another function.

Question 16:
What is a NULL pointer and far pointer?

Explanation:
Null Pointer - Null pointer is a pointer that does not refer to any address of value but to NULL.  When "0" is assigned to a pointer of any type, it creates a Null pointer.
Far Pointer - A far pointer is a pointer that can access all the 16 segments, i.e. the whole residence memory of the RAM.  It is a 32 bit pointer that obtains information from outside the memory in a given section.
Question 17:
What is a dangling pointer? How is it overcome?

Explanation:
Dangling pointer is a problem that arises when an object is deleted without modifying the value of the pointer. Thus the pointer is now pointing to a deallocated memory.

In other words, if a pointer say A is pointing to a memory location, but another pointer B deletes the memory occupied by A while A is still pointing to that location, A becomes a dangling pointer.

The problem is overcome by assigning a NULL value to the dangling pointer.
After de-allocating the memory from a pointer variable, the pointer is assigned to a NULL value.
Thus the pointer is not pointing to any memory location, therefore it's no longer a dangling pointer.
Question 18:
What is an infinite loop?

Question 11:
What is public static void main(string[]args) in Java?

Answer:
It is the main Java method, and is the entry point of all Java programs.

public:  it is the access modifier of the main method. It specifies who can access this method. The term “public” makes it available to all the classes.
static: At the start, there is no object class present, therefore the main method is static, which makes the JVM load the class into memory and call the main method.
void: In Java every program is required to provide a return type. However the main() method does not return anything hence its return type is void.
main: It informs the JVM that this is the main Java method.
string[]args: This is the java command line argument. It is an array of type java.lang.Stringclass. The name of the string array is args, and the user can rename it accordingly.
Question 12:
What is a JAVA string pool?

Answer:
Java string pool is a pool of strings that is stored in a memory heap. It is also known as String Intern Pool or String Constant Pool.

There are two ways to create a string in JAVA:

Using string literal
Using new keyword
Question 13:
What is shallow copy and deep copy in JAVA?

Answer:
Shallow Copy: When a shadow copy is implemented, the copied object copies the “original” object, however it does not copy the inner objects.

If the original object contains a reference variable, then the copied object will refer to the same object to which the original was referring to. Therefore a change in the original object will reflect the same in the shallow copy.

Therefore the shallow copy is dependent on the original object.

Deep Copy: When a deep copy is implemented, the copied object copies the original object. It also calls the clone() method which then makes copies of the references that the original object contained.

Thus any change in the original will not be reflected on the deep copy making it independent of the original object.

Consider an array arr[ ] of size N containing elements. Your task is to determine the next greater element for each element of the array in the order of their appearance.

The next greater element for an element in the array is defined as the nearest element on the right that is greater than the current element. If there is no element to the right that is greater than the current element, then the next greater element for the current element is -1. Specifically, the next greater element for the last element in the array is always -1.

While reading characters from the stream, your task is to identify, for each position i (0 ≤ i < n), the first character that appears only once in the stream up to that point. If there are multiple characters that have appeared only once, you should identify the first one among them. If there is no such character, append '#' to the answer.

Write a function or algorithm to efficiently solve this problem.

Example:

- For position 3: 'c' is the first character, so 'c' is the answer.

- For position 4: 'a' appears twice, so 'c' is the first non-repeating character.

- For position 5: 'b' appears twice, so 'c' is the first non-repeating character.

- For position 6: 'a' appears twice, so 'c' is the first non-repeating character.
